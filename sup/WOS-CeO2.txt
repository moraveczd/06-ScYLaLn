TI Nanoceria, the versatile nanoparticles: Promising biomedical
   applications
SO JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE
AB Nanotechnology has been a boon for the biomedical field due to the freedom it provides for tailoring of pharmacokinetic properties of different drug molecules. Nanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology for the diagnosis, treatment and/or management of the diseases. Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNPs) are metal oxide-based nanoparticles (NPs) which possess outstanding reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activities primarily due to the availability of "oxidation switch" on their surface. These NP have been found to protect from a number of disorders with a background of oxidative stress such as cancer, diabetes etc. In fact, the CNPs have been found to possess the environment-dependent ROS modulating properties. In addition, the inherent catalase, SOD, oxidase, peroxidase and phosphatase mimetic properties of CNPs provide them superiority over a number of NPs. Further, chemical reactivity of CNPs seems to be a function of their surface chemistry which can be precisely tuned by defect engineering. However, the contradictory reports make it necessary to critically evaluate the potential of CNPs, in the light of available literature. The review is aimed at probing the feasibility of CNPs to push towards the clinical studies. Further, we have also covered and censoriously discussed the suspected negative impacts of CNPs before making our way to a consensus. This review aims to be a comprehensive, authoritative, critical, and accessible review of general interest to the scientific community.

TI Solvothermal Synthesis Routes to Substituted Cerium Dioxide Materials
SO INORGANICS
AB We review the solution-based synthesis routes to cerium oxide materials where one or more elements are included in place of a proportion of the cerium, i.e., substitution of cerium is performed. The focus is on the solvothermal method, where reagents are heated above the boiling point of the solvent to induce crystallisation directly from the solution. This yields unusual compositions with crystal morphology often on the nanoscale. Chemical elements from all parts of the periodic table are considered, from transition metals to main group elements and the rare earths, including isovalent and aliovalent cations, and surveyed using the literature published in the past ten years. We illustrate the versatility of this synthesis method to allow the formation of functional materials with applications in contemporary applications such as heterogeneous catalysis, electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells, photocatalysis, luminescence and biomedicine. We pick out emerging trends towards control of crystal habit by use of non-aqueous solvents and solution additives and identify challenges still remaining, including in detailed structural characterisation, the understanding of crystallisation mechanisms and the scale-up of synthesis.

TI CeO2 Nanoparticle-Containing Polymers for Biomedical Applications: A
   Review
SO POLYMERS
AB The development of advanced composite biomaterials combining the versatility and biodegradability of polymers and the unique characteristics of metal oxide nanoparticles unveils new horizons in emerging biomedical applications, including tissue regeneration, drug delivery and gene therapy, theranostics and medical imaging. Nanocrystalline cerium(IV) oxide, or nanoceria, stands out from a crowd of other metal oxides as being a truly unique material, showing great potential in biomedicine due to its low systemic toxicity and numerous beneficial effects on living systems. The combination of nanoceria with new generations of biomedical polymers, such as PolyHEMA (poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-based hydrogels, electrospun nanofibrous polycaprolactone or natural-based chitosan or cellulose, helps to expand the prospective area of applications by facilitating their bioavailability and averting potential negative effects. This review describes recent advances in biomedical polymeric material practices, highlights up-to-the-minute cerium oxide nanoparticle applications, as well as polymer-nanoceria composites, and aims to address the question: how can nanoceria enhance the biomedical potential of modern polymeric materials?
